## Overview
Localizer helps you localize (add internalization) within your Xcode application within seconds, so you just have to focus on the code!
As it is built with Go, so speed isn't a compromise ðŸš€.

## Installation

### Using Go
```bash
go install github.com/27Saumya/localizer@latest
```

## Usage
```bash
localizer help
```
- You need to have a base `.lproj/` directory (for example:- `en.lproj`) and a `Localizable.strings` file containing the strings that need be to localized and thats it
- Separate the languages with a `space` you want to localize.

### Example Usage
```bash
localizer localize en.lproj fr de es
```
